# Chapter 1:
I believe my experience in ROV electronics and softwares pales in comparison to someone who has designed, built and tested their own ROVs. Hence, I aim to design and build a light and simple drone with general maneuvering capabilites to develope my knowledge on ROV electronics/software/systems.

Problem Definition
Need: Inexperienced in arial ROV electronics, software and systems.
Goal: An ordered research and design system for a simple and low-rescource drone concept/prototype.

Objectives/Constraints:
  - Objective (Organization): Chapter 1 subsection for research regarding each component of the simple drone --> units: sections per component
  - Objective (Organization): Weekly progress on any aspect of design/developement --> units: uploads per week
  - Objective (Drone): Drone design should minimize components --> units: total components
  - Objective (Drone): Drone design should minimize cost --> units: total cost
  - Objective (Drone): Drone design should maximze flight range --> units: meters
  - Objectuve (Drone): Drone design should maximize flight time --> units: Ah
