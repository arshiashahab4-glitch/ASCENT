# ASCENT

PROJECT: ASCENT
AUTHOR: ARSHIA SHAHAB

Preface: In the 10th grade I programmed a dji tello drone in python using their SDK. Now, I want to design and build my own drone to explore ROV spatial traversion capabilities in varying fields.

Chapter 1:
I believe my experience in ROV electronics and softwares pales in comparison to someone who has designed, built and tested their own ROVs. Hence, I aim to design and build a light and simple drone with general maneuvering capabilites to develope my knowledge on ROV electronics/software/systems.

Problem Definition
Need: To learn electronics/software/systems required to design and build an arial ROV.
Goal: Ordered research and design, simple and low-rescource.
